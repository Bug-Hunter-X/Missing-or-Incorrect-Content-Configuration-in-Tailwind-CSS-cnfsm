# Missing or Incorrect Content Configuration in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Tailwind CSS: an improperly configured or missing `content` property in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Problem
Tailwind CSS relies on the `content` property to scan your project's files for CSS classes. If this property is missing or incorrectly configured, Tailwind won't find and process the classes you are using, resulting in missing styles.  This leads to unexpected visual results in your application.

## Solution
Ensure that the `content` property is correctly set within your `tailwind.config.js` file to include all files containing your Tailwind CSS classes.  This typically involves specifying the paths to your template files (HTML, JSX, etc.).

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
3. Try to run your application: you'll see that the Tailwind classes won't be applied correctly because of the missing `content` property.
4. Uncomment the `content` property in `tailwind.config.js` and run the application again.  You will now see that the Tailwind classes are applied correctly.
